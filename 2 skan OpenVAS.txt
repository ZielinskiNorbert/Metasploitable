NVT:    SMB Brute Force Logins With Default Credentials
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.804449
Threat: High (CVSS: 10.0)
Port:   445/tcp

Summary:
A number of known default credentials are tried for the login
  via the SMB protocol.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was possible to login with the following credentials via the SMB protocol to !
the 'IPC$' share. <User>:<Password>
User:user

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Change the password as soon as possible.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Tries to login with a number of known default credentials via
  the SMB protocol.

NVT:    Samba MS-RPC Remote Shell Command Execution Vulnerability - Active Check
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108011
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 6.0)
Port:   445/tcp

Product detection result: cpe:/a:samba:samba:3.0.20
Detected by: SMB NativeLanMan (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.102011)

Summary:
Samba is prone to a vulnerability that allows attackers to
  execute arbitrary shell commands because the software fails to sanitize user-s!
upplied input.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.

Impact:
An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary shell
  commands on an affected system with the privileges of the application.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Updates are available. Please see the referenced vendor advisory.

Affected Software/OS:
This issue affects Samba 3.0.0 through 3.0.25rc3.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Send a crafted command to the samba server and check for a
  remote command execution.

Issue

NVT:    TCP Timestamps Information Disclosure
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows
  to compute the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 318412
Packet 2: 318532

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line
  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to appl!
y the settings at
  runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Tim!
estamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating co!
mmunication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by
  RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in
  between to the target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If foun!
d, the timestamps
  are reported.
